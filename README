[B]Roles[/B] - The user-driven group selection plugin.
[B]Version:[/B] v1.0

[b]You need at least [URL='http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/4723/']GroupManager[/URL] 1.0 alpha-5 to use this![/b]

[B]Features:[/B]
• Easy role categorization
• Good integration with GroupManager
• Let your users choose their roles in server, such as:factions, jobs, skills and etc. No need to do it for them.
• Time based "leave", so your users can't join-leave groups all the time. They need to wait the amount of hours you choose to leave a role.
• Multiworld support!

[B]Commands[/B]:
[CODE]commands:
  joinrole:
    description: Join a role of your choice.
    usage: /<command> [category] [group]
    permission: roles.joinrole
  leaverole:
    description: Leave a role of your choice.
    usage: /<command> [category] [group]
    permission: roles.leaverole
  myroles:
    description: List roles you have.
    usage: /<command> [category]
    permission: roles.myroles
  whoroles:
    description: List somebody else roles.
    usage: /<command> <player> [category]
    permission: roles.whoroles
  roles:
    description: Reload Roles configuration
    usage: /<command>
    permission: roles.roles[/CODE]
This system is quite simple, yet functional. Hope it fits most people needs.
All commands can be done only by players.

All groups are added as a user subGroup, except when the user join a role of the main category. [b]Those roles really change the user group when joined.[/b]

[B]Config file:[/B]
[CODE]world:
    categories:
        faction:
            limit: 1
            time: 168
        job:
            limit: 1
            time: 24
        subjob:
            limit: 2
            time: 12
        skill:
            limit: 4
            time: 1
    setting:
        defaultgroup: Peasant
        maincategory: faction
[/CODE]
• [b]world[/b] is the world name. This plugin respects GM mirroring, so the name of the world must be the the same of the real world which you have data on GroupManager.
• [b]faction,job,subjob,skill[/b] are the categories that you use on group specification. You can create as many as you want like that.(use always lower case, please)
• [b]limit[/b] is the quantity of roles of that category each user can join in. [i]subjob[/i] is 2, so everyuser can join in two [i]subjobs[/i] role.
• [b]time[/b] is the amount of time, in hours, a player need to wait before leaving a group that he joined of such category. The usual is the bigger the role, the bigger the time. No need to explain that.
• [b] maincategory[/b] You can optionally set a category for users to choose their main groups. When a group change a role of main category, he will have his prefix, suffix, build and other variables affected, just like he get physically changed groups(instead of subgrouping).
• [b]defaultgroup[/b] will tell Roles to which group should take a user if he leaves a group of the main category. So if you leave your faction, you will be redirected to Peasant group. No need for this if you don't use main category.

[B]Got it! So, where are the groups?[/B]
In your GroupManager… for every group, there are special variables you put in them, where Roles will read and decide what to do.

These nodes go inside the INFO node for every group you want to set as a Role.
• [B]roles-category: faction[/B] - Type accepted: String - Explanation: this is setting a group for a role called faction
• [B]roles-requirement: Miner[/B] - Type accepted: List/String - Explanation: this telling you that for you to join this role, you must have joined a role(group) called Miner.
Every entry of the list is considered a full requirement, so you just need to fulfill one of the requirements to be able to join.
Example:
[CODE]roles-requirement:
  - BlueFaction
  - RedFaction[/CODE]
To enforce multiple roles as requirement, you put role names in same entry separated by the character '&', just like this:
[CODE]roles-requirement: Fighter&SuperCart[/CODE]
